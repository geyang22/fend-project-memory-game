## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## How to Play the Game
The player clicks two cards. When a card is clicked, the image on a card is uncovered. The task is to find eight pairs of matching images. When two matching images are found, the cards remain flipped. The game ends when all of the matches are found (all cards stay flipped). The time is counted and the star rating assigned depending on the number of moves it took to win the game. The goal is to use minimal time and number of moves.


## Getting started
Download the game source code. Dependencies are font-awesome (https://fontawesome.com/), jQuery, and bootstrap.

Open index.html with your browser, the game will start, if not check errors with your browser debugging utility.
